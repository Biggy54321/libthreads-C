# libthreads-C

A implementation of one-one, many-many and hybrid threading models for user
threads in C.

For evaluation please consider only **hybrid** and **one-one** directories, as
the **many-many** was developed to cater the initial needs of the **hybrid**
implementation and was not touched after that. However all the **many-many**
features (and even some more) are provided in the **hybrid** implementation.
